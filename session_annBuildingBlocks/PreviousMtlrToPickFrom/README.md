# PreviousMtlrToPickFrom

This folder contains relevant presentations from previous courses and JC sessions, from which material can be taken.

Some presentations are in RMarkdown format (.Rmd), while we aim at using Jupyter notebooks (if possible). However, the R-code snippets producing figures should be reusable also in Jupyter (I hope). The end-point html files for these presentations are included for viewability.

So far the following material is available:

#### ann1 and ann2
presentations on the NBIS Integrative JC on artificial neural networks. In particular there are iGraph-based functions allowing for drawing networks; although customized for this presenrtation and not very general, these could prove useful.

- ann1 is an introduction to ann theory, including perceptrons, sigmoid nurons and activation function, feed-forward anns, mean square error function, gradient descent (some theory), back-propagation (quite some theory)
- ann2 biuilds on ann1 and describes (some) variants of activation functions and error functions - discussing pros and cons in relation to learning efficiency.

#### ann_dnn_medbioinfo
a set of lectures prepared for a Machine Learning workshop within the MedBioInfo program. Includes:
- a theory section on neural networks, from the perceptron to multi-layer perceptrons (plus some details about more complex architectures)
- a jupyter notebook covering the introduction to TensorFlow and Keras on a number of basic classification problems
