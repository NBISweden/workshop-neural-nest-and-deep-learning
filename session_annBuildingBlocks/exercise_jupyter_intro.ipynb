It shares som similarities with Rmarkdown and Rstudio, which some of you mnight be familiar with, but while Rmarkdown was developed focusing on the R language, Jupyter Notebooks was developed focusing on the Pyhton language. (however, both these tools has since further developed to include also other programming languages.)\n",
