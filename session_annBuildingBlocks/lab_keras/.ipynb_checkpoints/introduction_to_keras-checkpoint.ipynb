    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).\n",
    "* Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.\n",
    "* Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be mostly writing python code using Keras libraries, but \"under the hood\" Keras is using tensorflow libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation is at [keras.io](https://keras.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "## If you want to use R instead of python\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras can run on R as well, it will look quite similar to the code in this notebook (but, you know, with <- instead of =). You find the docs here: https://keras.rstudio.com/"
