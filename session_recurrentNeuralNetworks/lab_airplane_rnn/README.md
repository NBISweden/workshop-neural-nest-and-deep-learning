# Airplanes lab

This lab illustrates the basic principles of RNNs. The objective is to
use a timeseries of airplane passenger data and predict future
passenger numbers.

## Intended learning outcomes

- make simple RNN models, both using SimpleRNN and LSTM/GRU
- focus on writing models from scratch and trying out different
  parameters and settings
- rescale data to restricted ranges for improved training
