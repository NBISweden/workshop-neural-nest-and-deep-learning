### Proposed prequisites for the NBIS Neural Nest & Deep Learning workshop

- Basic python skills (possibly NBIS python workshop?)
[maybe prepare a questionnaire to evaluate actual skills]
- Corresponding to the NBIS Biostatistics/ML knowledge
[otherwise: Calculus/some math at university level?]
- (Completing [currently none-existing] pre-course material/quiz)
