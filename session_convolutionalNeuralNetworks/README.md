(4h)

## Lecture
- Will be adapted from the Deep Learning course from Olivier Grisel and Charles Ollion (https://m2dsupsdlclass.github.io/lectures-labs/) and the Deep Learning in Image Analysis course from Damian Matuszewski.

## Lab 1: Classification of Human Blood Cells using Convolutional Neural Networks

In this notebook we will solve the classification of small images task with convolutional neural networks.

## Lab 2: Segmentation of Human Blood Cells using Convolutional Neural Networks

In this notebook we will try to do semantic segmentation of Blood Cell images.
