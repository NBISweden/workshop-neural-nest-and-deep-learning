#### Practical issues
- Try to keep your **cameras on**, but **microphone muted**
- Lectures with many breaks
- Take lots of small breaks also when working with the exercises
- We will try to stick to the schedule, but it's only preliminary
until it's happened
- If you have any questions during the lecture, feel free to unmute
 and ask. If you don't want to ask in the Zoom meeting, write the
  question in the chat or on slack
