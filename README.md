# NBIS workshop in Neural Nets and Deep Learning

This is the NBIS repository for the Neural Nets and Deep Learning workshop.

## Setting up course.

The proposed timeline for course planning is as follows:

1. By the end of week 45 (2-8 Nov 2020), we would like you to share an outline
for every teacher/section of the course with us. This does not mean that
all lectures and labs should be ready by then, but rather to give an idea
of what concepts will be covered, maybe what tools and perhaps hardware
is planned to be used.
2. The week after, we will try to have short one-on-one (or session-wise)
meetings to discuss further, followed by
3. A meeting with everyone in the call to present the final outlines
4. We should aim to have all material in working condition by the end of
November


## Course material.

* Each session should create a folder `session_XX`, under which the
relevant files should be kept.
    - If needed, create separate subfolders for `lecture` and `lab`.
* The main format for labs/tutorials are Jupyter notebooks (iPython),
an exception is the session on keras in R (of course)
* The recommended, but by no means enforced, format for lectures is
also Jupyter notebooks.


## Contact
* Contact course leaders ([Claudio](claudio.mirabello@scilifelab.se),
[Bengt](bengt.sennblad@scilifelab.se)) if you have questions
